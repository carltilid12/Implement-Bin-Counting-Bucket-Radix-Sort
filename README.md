# Implement-Bin-Counting-Bucket-Radix-Sort
Implement Bin Sort, Counting Sort, Bucket Sort and Radix Sort

Implement the linear sorting algorithms as described in Slide CSC124_L02c_Sorting.  Just like the previous exercises experiment on different input sizes and graph the input size versus the time it takes to run the sorting algorithms. Do these algorithms really run at O(n) time?
